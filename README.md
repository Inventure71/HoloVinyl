# HoloVinyl

## Overview

HoloVinyl bridges the gap between physical objects and digital music. By leveraging computer vision, it allows users to connect any object to a song, playlist, or album, serving as a modern replacement for vinyl records.

## Features

- **Object Recognition**: Use any physical object as a key to access music.
- **Music Mapping**: Assign a song, playlist, or album to an object.
- **Seamless Playback**: Automatically play music when the object is detected.
- **Customizable Experience**: Personalize object-music associations.

## How It Works

1. **Capture**: The system scans and identifies an object using a camera.
2. **Recognition**: Computer vision algorithms recognize the object.
3. **Music Retrieval**: The associated song, playlist, or album is fetched.
4. **Playback**: The music starts playing instantly.

## Installation & Usage

(Details on setup, dependencies, and running the project will be added soon.)

## Future Plans

- Enhance recognition accuracy with AI improvements.
- Support for multiple users and object-music mappings.
- Integration with streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music.
